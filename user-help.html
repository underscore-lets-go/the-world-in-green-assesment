            <h1>Drive Less</h1>
            <h4>To reduce the effect you have in the enviroment, a proven way is to drive less and instead; walk, cycle or car pool to your destination. </h4>
            <h4>This can reduce your CO2 dramatically as it means that you are not contrubiting as much top the CO2 released from vehicles</h4>
        </div>
    
        <div class="right">
            <h1>Reduce electricty use</h1>
            <h4>Reducing electyricity useable is an easy thing we can all do. It can be as easy as turning a light off whe youy leave a room, or running a diswhaser only when its full</h4>
            <h4>This means that there is less demand for the fosslil fueled engery production, therefore there is less CO2 emmisions from fossil fuel power plants</h4>

            <h1>Conserve Water</h1>
            <h4>It is evident that in the near future that water supplies are going to become scarce. If we conserve water we are ensuring that there will be water in the summer moneth, allowing plants to contiune growing. </h4>
            <h4>It is an easy thing we can all do by shortening the length of showers and reducing the amount that we water our gardens</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <h1>Plant trees</h1>
            <h4>Planting trees is not only somthing that can bring life into a garden but can also have a huge benifit for earth. </h4>
            <h4>Trees convert the harmful gas CO2 into oxygen which is critical for the survival of the human race and all animal species on earth</h4>

            <h1>Donate to a Climate change Research Facility</h1>
            <h4>As much as we do know about climate change... there is still a large amount we don't know. Donating could significantly further the infromation we currently have on the topic </h4>
            <h4>The more we find out about climate change the better our abilty to reverse its effects, and maybe even return to a better path of climate</h4>

            <h1>Preasure Governments</h1>
            <h4>Many governments take alot of promting to initiat any type of change. You could convince your government to start a climate policy by starting or signing a petition.</h4>
            <h4>A petition could convice the government to start action to help prevent the permant effects fo climate change on a national level.</h4>
